# Galactic Orbit Simulation - Milky Way

## 📌 Objective
This project simulates the stellar dynamics of the Milky Way galaxy using observational data from Gaia DR2. By modeling the Galactic gravitational potential and integrating stellar orbits, the goal is to analyze and interpret the formation and kinematics of low- and high-mass stars in the solar neighborhood.

## 📝 Abstract
The project uses Gaia DR2 data (positions and velocities of stars) to compare various Galactic potential models. Orbits are integrated for a selection of stars, and their properties—such as maximum vertical height (zmax), eccentricity, apocenter, and pericenter—are analyzed. Results indicate that younger stars tend to have less vertical and less eccentric orbits than older stars.
